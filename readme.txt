Thank you for using our GitHub project!

We recommend you to install this directory somewhere on your computer, where you can easily access it from the terminal (so don't have directory names with spaces in it or you clone the directory into the temp. folder).
To start up the program, type in "python PythonGUI.py" in your terminal in your cloned github folder (Workflow-course-11).
By activating the GUI, you can now select any of the options and run any script that's included in the directory. 
(You can run any of the following options in the GUI on any computer: Gene Finder, Find Orthologues and Motif Search. The option "MEME" and "run all scripts" can only be runned correctly from a HAN account on a computer from the HAN university, unless you install MEME (motif searcher) on your computer and change the paths in the callMEME.py script)
