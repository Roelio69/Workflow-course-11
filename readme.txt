Installing help:
Thank you for using our GitHub project!

We recommend you to install this directory somewhere on your computer, where you can easily access it from the terminal (so don't have directory names without space's or the directory is located in the temp. folder).
To start up the program, type in "python PythonGUI.py" in your terminal in your cloned github folder (Workflow-course-11).
By activating the GUI, you can now select any of the options and run any script that's included in the directory.
